      <h3 className='about'>And maybe, maybe, maybe... Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. Zip. That easy.

Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Just make a decision and let it go. We have a fantastic little sky! It looks so good, I might as well not stop.

Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. In life you need colors. There it is. You have to make those little noises or it won't work.

Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. Little short strokes. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. Here's another little happy bush I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself.

In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. Those great big fluffy clouds. Just let these leaves jump off the brush

I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents.

Let's get crazy. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. The light is your friend. Preserve it. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends.</h3>
